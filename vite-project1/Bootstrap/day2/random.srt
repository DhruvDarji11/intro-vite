1
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:44,377
Listen, it sounded like the brown-
breasted bottle-beaked hooting owl.

2
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:50,383
Sherman, did you really bring me all
the way out here just to look at birds?

3
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:51,851
I thought you liked birds.

4
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:55,988
Yes, but sometimes there are
other things I'd like to see.

5
00:00:55,989 --> 00:01:00,193
- Like what?
- Like a movie.

6
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:05,998
Shh. Hear that? The owl is near.

7
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:26,686
- Sherman.
- Yes?

8
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:30,256
Does it have unusually large eyes?

9
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:33,726
Oh, yes. I'd say so.
It's a nocturnal predator.

10
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:36,129
And a giant pointy beak...

11
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:39,799
and fur?

12
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,804
You know, Treena,
I'd be up for a movie.

13
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:07,647
He did it. Scooby-Doo
captured the monster.

14
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:09,877
Scooby-Dooby-Doo.

15
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:18,224
It's not a real monster.

16
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:21,594
It's actually Miss Thelmer,
the company accountant.

17
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:24,530
My plan was perfect.
How did you ever...?

18
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,469
Hi, Mom. Can't talk, exposition time.

19
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,371
What? Hang on.

20
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:35,174
Will you take the wrap-up,
Freddie? I'm back.

21
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:37,777
Miss Thelmer is actually
a corporate spy.

22
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:41,380
She pretended to be the so-called
Chemical Creep to scare people away...

23
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:44,611
while she stole the
company's secret formulas.

24
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:50,848
From now on, the only books you'll be
keeping will be from the prison library.

25
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:56,429
Well, another successful
case is closed.

26
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:00,566
All right, dude, I say we celebrate
with a party at the Burger Binge.

27
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:01,967
Yeah.

28
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,403
Burger Binge, Burger Binge.

29
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:06,672
I've got a better idea.

30
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:09,575
Shaggy, you remember
my little sister Madelyn?

31
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:12,678
Little doe-eyes Dinkley?
Like, how could I forget?

32
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:15,247
That's not nice.
She really liked you.

33
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:18,851
I'm sorry, Vel. Mads is a sweet kid.
We'll have to look her up sometime.

34
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:22,188
That time is now. My mom
wants us to check up on her.

35
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:24,657
- Is something wrong?
- You might say that.

36
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,493
Madelyn's going to a special
school for stage magicians.

37
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:30,830
And, well, according to my mom...

38
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:34,133
the school's being
threatened by a griffin.

39
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:38,270
Zoinks. Not a griffin.
I mean, anything but a griffin.

40
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:39,672
Like, what's a griffin?

41
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:42,208
A creature that's
half eagle, half lion.

42
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:43,876
Couldn't it make up its mind?

43
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:46,679
It's a legend, Shaggy.
Mostly from medieval times.

44
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,314
It doesn't really exist.

45
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:50,149
I've heard that rap before.

46
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,718
Come on, we can't say
no to Velma's mom.

47
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:56,322
But can't we say yes
to a burger party first?

48
00:05:56,323 --> 00:06:01,226
Burger Binge, Burger Binge,
Burger Binge.

49
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:11,370
All right, Scooby-Doo, go fish.

50
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,905
I can't, Shaggy.

51
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:16,008
- Why not?
- I don't have a fishing pole.

52
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:19,645
Your next turn is 5 miles ahead.

53
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:21,547
Watch out for the dips in the road...

54
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,884
not including the ones in the
back seat. Ha, ha. That's a joke.

55
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,519
Pothole.

56
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,489
Watch out. Will you please
keep your eyes on the road?

57
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,726
I'm not sure about the Mystery
Machine's new GPS, Fred.

58
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,328
Where did you get your
license, from a hobo?

59
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,264
I know, isn't it awesome?

60
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:41,734
This is the magician school?
It looks like a castle.

61
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,169
It is a castle.

62
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,604
O'Flannery Manor
originated in Ireland...

63
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:48,207
where it was known for
its mystical happenings.

64
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:51,644
Back in the 19th century,
its owner, Lord Seamus O'Flannery...

65
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:54,947
had it transported to
America brick by brick.

66
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:58,717
It says here that Seamus
O'Flannery practiced dark magic.

67
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,021
Pretty creepy, eh, Scoob?

68
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:04,123
Yeah, creepy.

69
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:06,926
It gets creepier.
When he passed on...

70
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:10,930
Seamus had himself entombed in
an island crypt on the nearby lake.

71
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:14,366
Man, am I happy we
forgot our swimsuits.

72
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:18,571
The castle was auctioned recently and cost
the magician a pretty penny to buy it.

73
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:23,304
Turn left at the next pine tree.
Left. Wake up, people.

74
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:29,748
Are you sure about this?

75
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:33,719
Relax, scarf boy,
we're taking the scenic route.

76
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,755
Everybody calls it
a scarf. It's an ascot.

77
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:39,315
Hang a right at the weeping willow.

78
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,692
Right.

79
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:45,056
Veer left at the rhododendron.

80
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,930
Make a U-turn at the skunk.

81
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:58,110
- Ha, ha, ha.
- Fred, this can't be right.

82
00:07:58,111 --> 00:08:00,806
I better check the
warranty on this thing.

83
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:19,231
Hey, look, it's the
road to the school.

84
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:21,199
There it is.

85
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,124
- Jinkies.
- Velma.

86
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,121
Madelyn.

87
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:53,632
Oh, it's so good to see you.
You look so adorable.

88
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:57,236
Oh, my gosh. I can't believe it.
You're really here. My big sister.

89
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:59,872
- Hi, Madelyn.
- Hi, Daphne.

90
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:02,273
Hi, Freddie.

91
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:04,944
Hi, Scooby.

92
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:18,857
Uh... Ha...

93
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:20,916
Hi, Shaggy.

94
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:24,263
Hi, Madelyn.

95
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:25,856
Welcome, everyone.

96
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:34,873
I'm Whirlen Merlin,
maestro of the magical academy.

97
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:37,001
Alakazam.

98
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:47,017
And this lovely lady is my
former stage assistant, Crystal.

99
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:50,589
Hm. I guess this school doesn't
have much of a dress code.

100
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,257
Yeah.

101
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,728
Greetings. I teach
prestidigitary assistantship.

102
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:59,465
I'm also in charge of caring
for our magical co-stars.

103
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:08,607
This is Vernon, our star performer.

104
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:12,077
But don't worry,
he's a real pussycat.

105
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:14,113
Nice to meet you.

106
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:17,608
Yipe.

107
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:19,952
1, 2, 3...

108
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,820
4. Phew.

109
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:24,957
We better hurry. It's almost dark.

110
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,494
Don't wanna be around when
you-know-what drops by.

111
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,062
All right, Marlon.

112
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:32,264
Marlon here is our
resident stagehand.

113
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:34,066
He runs things behind the scenes.

114
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:36,001
We wouldn't have a show without him.

115
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:38,737
Marlon, please see to
our guests' luggage.

116
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:41,874
Already finished, boss.
See you inside.

117
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:45,970
Yeah, Scoob, like,
maybe we better go in.

118
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:49,272
Repeat after me.

119
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:52,275
Open, sesame.

120
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:54,820
Open, sesame.

121
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,186
Open, sesame

122
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:08,995
I hope you find your time at
O'Flannery Castle exciting.

123
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:13,439
It's the grandest magic
academy in existence.

124
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,542
Gee, I wonder where
all the students are.

125
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:17,976
I don't know.

126
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:22,114
In their rooms, where it's safe.

127
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:24,383
This is Miss Alma Rumblebuns.

128
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:26,952
She was custodian of the
castle before I bought it.

129
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:29,855
And now she's a housekeeper
to the students.

130
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,925
This facility allows
performing animals only.

131
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:37,396
Oh, that's okay. Scooby's
been through training school.

132
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:39,660
Yeah. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

133
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:51,537
Whoa. Whoa!

134
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:05,156
Oh, like, he was dropped on
his head when he was a puppy.

135
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:10,225
Oh, very well. I will
show you your rooms.

136
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:24,340
Cone Castle commercial, take one.

137
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,278
<i>We're Cone Castle cones</i>

138
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,313
<i>And we're healthy for you</i>

139
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:31,583
<i>Run to your grocer and pick up a few</i>

140
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,853
<i>Mixing grown-up flavors
Into kids' ice cream</i>

141
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,054
- Liver.
- Onion.

142
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:40,626
- Broccoli.
- We're a gourmet lover's dream.

143
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:43,729
Hold it, hold it.

144
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:46,165
Pardon me for halting
the festivities...

145
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:50,569
but I distinctly remember paying
for a buttered Brussels sprout.

146
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:54,870
Ooh, um, sorry, I'm here.

147
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:57,066
Oopsie daisy.

148
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:00,538
Oh, for heaven's sakes.

149
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:06,718
Can someone please manage this mess?

150
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:11,623
And you there, your cone is crumpled.

151
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,125
Yes?

152
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:16,428
Mr. Curdles, it's me, Amos.

153
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:21,233
Remember when you told me to
call if any more students arrived?

154
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:26,438
- I saw 4 kids and a dog.
- 4 kids and a dog, eh? Heh, heh.

155
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:30,576
Whirlen must be awfully desperate
if he's enrolling animals.

156
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:34,446
Perhaps they'll get another
visit from the you-know-what.

157
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:39,318
He's showing up almost nightly these
days and getting bolder each time.

158
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,887
I'd hate to think what
could happen tonight.

159
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:45,152
I'm sure you'll let me know.

160
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:54,997
Will no one dab up this dairy?

161
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:58,403
They say Lord O'Flannery
practiced real magic.

162
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:01,440
And that he had many secrets
built into the castle walls.

163
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:04,776
Legend has it that he even conjured
up a griffin to protect it...

164
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:10,616
and housed the monster in that old
tower... called the Griffin's Roost.

165
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:15,020
Why doesn't Whirlen Merlin knock it down
and put up a student union or something?

166
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:19,124
He's hoping to restore it someday.
But until then, it's off-limits.

167
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:22,127
His career goes all the way
back to when he was a kid.

168
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:24,396
He started with
neighborhood puppet shows.

169
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:26,965
Oh, and over here is his trophy case.

170
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:29,368
This is Whirlen Merlin
when he was onstage.

171
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:30,702
Isn't he awesome?

172
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,639
I had no idea you were
so into magic, Madelyn.

173
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,108
At least you've finally
settled on something.

174
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:38,844
Where were you last
semester, clown college?

175
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:42,881
Heh, heh. Yeah, so I've
done some soul searching.

176
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:46,084
Not everyone is born with a
mystery book in her hand, Velma.

177
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:48,020
Well, I think magic is really cool.

178
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:50,589
I've always been fascinated
by how it's done.

179
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,925
Just as Velma loves
to solve mysteries...

180
00:14:52,926 --> 00:14:57,763
I love to uncover the secrets of magic,
and this is the perfect school for that.

181
00:14:57,764 --> 00:15:00,198
What about that griffin? Mom said...

182
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:03,035
Mom's just dramatic.
It's a silly old myth.

183
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:10,809
That's our dinner bell.

184
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,334
Alakazam.

185
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:17,582
And because you're our
special guests of honor...

186
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,278
I've asked the chef...

187
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:21,720
That's me.

188
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:24,056
To prepare a royal feast.

189
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:25,490
A feast.

190
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:29,290
Like, I think he said the magic word.

191
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:40,973
The guests of honor almost
outnumber the students.

192
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:42,407
And where are the teachers?

193
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:46,945
A lot of them left thanks
to that scary old griffin...

194
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,641
which no one has
ever seen, of course.

195
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:53,852
Before we start,
a little dinner lighting.

196
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:55,445
Alakazam.

197
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:08,633
Far out. Dinner by candlelight.

198
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,261
How romantic.

199
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:13,868
Let's eat.

200
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:21,313
Gee, Scoob, I think it's
a little undercooked.

201
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,904
Do not worry, never fear.

202
00:16:24,905 --> 00:16:28,947
Your favorite dish will now appear.

203
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:31,949
Pinch me, Scooby-Doo,

204
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:37,294
extra cheesy cheese pizza
with a side of pickles.

205
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:45,998
Scooby Snacks in cherry
sauce and whipped cream.

206
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:52,472
Ho, ho, ho.

207
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,082
Wow. Whirlen is amazing.

208
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,949
- Aw.
- I cooked it.

209
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:10,152
What's that?

210
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:42,820
It's a devil of a night out there.

211
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,805
The kind of night that invites ghosts

212
00:17:46,806 --> 00:17:50,936
and goblins and other visitors.

213
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:52,706
Uh, Miss Rumblebuns,

214
00:17:52,707 --> 00:17:56,208
is it okay if some of us
go back to our rooms?

215
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:58,802
I suppose so.

216
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:06,017
Psst. Shaggy, come on.

217
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:09,387
While everyone else is eating,
I wanna show you something special.

218
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:12,424
- Like, now?
- Yes, while the moon is still out.

219
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:15,594
I promise you're going to
find it very, very exciting.

220
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:21,025
You know, Madelyn, I find this
pizza very, very, very exciting.

221
00:18:21,868 --> 00:18:23,995
Come on.

222
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:37,649
Are you sure you wanna go out
in the dark? It's kind of spooky.

223
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:40,252
Amos the groundskeeper
is always out after dark.

224
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:43,221
Yeah, well, that dude's
totally spooky too.

225
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:46,658
What I wanna show is something that
was brought here with the castle...

226
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:49,561
over 2 centuries ago.

227
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,261
Hurry, guys, it's right
around the bend.

228
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:12,040
Here we are.

229
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:21,248
I found a picture of this sundial
on one of the castle walls.

230
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:31,566
When the moon is full and
you twist it like so...

231
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:57,495
That's Seamus O'Flannery, the man who
brought the castle over here from Ireland.

232
00:19:57,496 --> 00:20:01,659
Wow. Like, dig that crazy toothpick.

233
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:06,755
Shaggy, that's the magic staff used
to summon and control the griffin.

234
00:20:06,756 --> 00:20:09,708
What? I thought you said
the griffin was a myth.

235
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,910
I didn't want the others
to be frightened.

236
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:14,379
I'm telling you because you're brave.

237
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,649
Brave? Shaggy? Brave?

238
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:25,023
Sorry.

239
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,894
Like, what's all this
gruesome graffiti?

240
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:34,699
It says, "Winged protector,
arise and guard this castle."

241
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:42,336
Don't look now.
But I think it's arisen.

242
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:29,246
Through here.

243
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:31,812
Down.

244
00:21:33,326 --> 00:21:34,793
Good thinking, Shaggy.

245
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,361
Like, who's thinking?

246
00:21:41,267 --> 00:21:45,603
Did you see how Whirlen Merlin made
that dessert appear out of nowhere?

247
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:48,006
Not really. I was watching Crystal.

248
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:49,641
All she did was point.

249
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:52,811
It's the way she did
it so effortlessly.

250
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,379
I can point too.

251
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:57,615
Usually when you do you
knock my glasses off.

252
00:21:57,616 --> 00:22:00,919
Easy, Velma. She hasn't done
that in at least an hour.

253
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,411
Ha, ha. Very funny, scarf boy.

254
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,425
Griffin!

255
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:11,785
It's the griffin!

256
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:21,806
Oh, my gosh, there it is.

257
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:25,208
That's right, Daddy.
I told you it was real.

258
00:22:27,046 --> 00:22:29,309
Holy Houdini.

259
00:22:29,615 --> 00:22:32,484
Open sesame, open sesame.

260
00:22:32,485 --> 00:22:35,146
Open sesame now.

261
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:42,293
This way, guys.

262
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:06,818
When I enrolled Maxwell in your school
I didn't expect dodging monsters...

263
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:10,255
to be a part of the curriculum.
Good day, sir.

264
00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:14,159
But we didn't know
the griffin was real.

265
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:18,960
Poor Whirlen. There go
the rest of his students.

266
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:21,666
Where are you going?

267
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:24,769
Aren't we taking Madelyn
home because of the griffin?

268
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:28,433
No, Shaggy.
The griffin has us curious.

269
00:23:38,117 --> 00:23:39,884
Oh, looks like school's out.

270
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:43,588
- Who's he?
- Calvin Curdles, the cone king.

271
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:47,786
He's been trying to buy O'Flannery Castle
since Whirlen beat him in the auction.

272
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,628
Alma, you look lovely as always.

273
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:53,431
Oh, here, have a
sardine in castor oil.

274
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:56,868
It will enhance your
lovely complexion.

275
00:23:56,869 --> 00:24:01,396
Don't try to con me
with your cones, Calvin.

276
00:24:03,242 --> 00:24:05,743
Thought I'd bring something
for the kiddies.

277
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:10,476
Oh. But I see there
aren't any kiddies left.

278
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:18,890
I told you, Curdles,
I'm not ready to sell.

279
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:20,091
Really?

280
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:23,161
Not even after your little
pest-control problem?

281
00:24:23,162 --> 00:24:25,730
The magic academy has
been my dream for years.

282
00:24:25,731 --> 00:24:29,267
And we're not about to give it up
for one little scare. Are we, gang?

283
00:24:29,268 --> 00:24:32,804
- No way.
- Well... Uh...

284
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:35,473
Why do you want the
castle, Mr. Curdles?

285
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:38,810
Well, my inquisitive little miss...

286
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:44,215
my dream is to retool it
into my flagship restaurant.

287
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:46,985
Then I'll open more restaurants.

288
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:50,288
Soon I'll have kids
all over the world...

289
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:56,261
eating my vegetable and variety
meat-flavored ice-cream cones.

290
00:24:56,262 --> 00:25:00,095
But won't the griffin scare
away all your customers?

291
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:03,134
Yes. Well, uh...

292
00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:08,306
I really don't believe in
things I don't believe in.

293
00:25:08,307 --> 00:25:10,141
Neither do we, Mr. Curdles.

294
00:25:10,142 --> 00:25:12,310
Which is why we
intend to investigate.

295
00:25:12,311 --> 00:25:16,748
Griffin or no griffin, my offer
won't be around forever, Whirlen.

296
00:25:16,749 --> 00:25:18,807
I suggest you reconsider.

297
00:25:18,918 --> 00:25:21,386
Soon.

298
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:36,123
Hmph.

299
00:25:39,071 --> 00:25:42,301
Call me if you hear anything.

300
00:25:45,444 --> 00:25:47,712
He's right. I don't know what to do.

301
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:50,448
We've got a school
and no one to teach.

302
00:25:50,449 --> 00:25:51,716
You still have me.

303
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:55,053
I wouldn't mind taking
one of your classes.

304
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:58,256
- That might not be a bad idea.
- What?

305
00:25:58,257 --> 00:26:00,959
We should take some classes
to learn more about magic.

306
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,161
It could help us with
our investigation.

307
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:05,964
We would be delighted to teach you.

308
00:26:05,965 --> 00:26:11,432
The full faculty of the Whirlen Merlin
Academy of Magic is at your command.

309
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:44,886
Hm.

310
00:28:49,428 --> 00:28:50,995
What in the world?

311
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:17,111
Whoa.

312
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:18,956
Daphne?

313
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:20,158
Hey, Vel.

314
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:21,683
What's going on?

315
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:23,995
I'm tired of being klutzy old Daphne.

316
00:29:23,996 --> 00:29:29,448
From now on I'm dazzling Daphne.
Centered, controlled, graceful.

317
00:29:29,468 --> 00:29:33,070
Does this have anything to do with
Fred going gaga over Crystal?

318
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:35,266
No.

319
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,580
Maybe.

320
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:44,482
Why are you snooping at this hour?

321
00:29:44,483 --> 00:29:47,652
I thought you'd be doing the
sisterly slumber party with Madelyn.

322
00:29:47,653 --> 00:29:52,123
It's great to see Mads again but we
don't seem to have that much in common.

323
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:55,126
Just between you and me,
she's kind of a nerd.

324
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:56,460
No kidding.

325
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:59,597
Once she gloms onto something,
there's no stopping her.

326
00:29:59,598 --> 00:30:03,367
She's always over-analyzing every
little thing that attracts her attention.

327
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:08,799
Hmm. There's some gritty residue
on the floor. Could be a clue.

328
00:30:08,874 --> 00:30:12,944
- It's rosin. Dancers put it on their shoes.
- I knew that.

329
00:30:12,945 --> 00:30:17,348
Yeah, you and your sister
are like night and day.

330
00:30:23,589 --> 00:30:25,456
It must be stuck.

331
00:30:25,457 --> 00:30:28,687
- A little help?
- Sure.

332
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:34,322
Thanks. Nothing like a workout
to control the klutziness.

333
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:43,374
That wasn't klutziness.
That happened on its own.

334
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:45,502
Come on.

335
00:31:05,264 --> 00:31:09,723
This stuff must have been shipped over
from Ireland along with the castle.

336
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,603
Some of this is more recent.

337
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:16,674
This photo album can't be more
than 20 years old. Jinkies.

338
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:18,576
Isn't that Miss Rumblebuns?

339
00:31:18,577 --> 00:31:20,978
It's hard to tell. She's smiling.

340
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:23,748
Madelyn says Alma's
worked here all her life.

341
00:31:23,749 --> 00:31:26,317
Even before Whirlen
won it in an auction.

342
00:31:26,318 --> 00:31:29,320
This castle's like her home.

343
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:32,153
Oh, my gosh.

344
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:34,125
That's Mr. Curdles.

345
00:31:34,126 --> 00:31:38,195
They must have been boyfriend
and girlfriend. It takes all kinds.

346
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:40,231
I guess.

347
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:42,393
- Ooh.
- Ew.

348
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:46,570
We have to build up our energy in
case we see that creepy griffin again.

349
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:49,073
Like, who can run away
on an empty stomach?

350
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:50,474
Not me.

351
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:57,114
I think we hit that kitchen
in the nick of time, Scoob.

352
00:31:58,951 --> 00:32:01,585
Like, your tummy is growling.

353
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,212
Not my tummy.

354
00:32:05,324 --> 00:32:10,261
Well, if it's not your tummy,
and it's not my tummy...

355
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:14,030
like, it's his tummy.

356
00:32:20,906 --> 00:32:22,771
Scoob.

357
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:31,315
Zoinks. A dead end. Nowhere to hide.

358
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:33,784
Look.

359
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:52,996
Phew.

360
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:56,374
Hello.

361
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:11,012
Like, come on, Scoob,
make friends with the nice kitty cat.

362
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,259
Yikes!

363
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:18,593
On second thought,
let's let him eat in peace.

364
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:39,776
Hey, look.

365
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,820
Puppets.

366
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:48,551
Like, this must be where they
store their Halloween decorations.

367
00:33:48,927 --> 00:33:52,863
Hey, Scoob, how many times
have we run into goons like this?

368
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:57,134
"And I would've got away with it too
if it weren't for you meddling kids."

369
00:33:59,571 --> 00:34:01,605
"And your dog too."

370
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,880
What are you doing in here?

371
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,850
Like, uh, we were just...

372
00:34:12,851 --> 00:34:15,751
No one is allowed in this room.

373
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:26,527
Not students, not visitors,
and especially not fleabags.

374
00:34:31,203 --> 00:34:33,295
- Huh?
- Huh?

375
00:34:47,352 --> 00:34:50,754
Like, dude, how do
you get out of here?

376
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:55,453
Scooby? Scooby-Doo, where are you?

377
00:34:57,729 --> 00:34:59,797
Hey, who killed the light show?

378
00:34:59,798 --> 00:35:02,095
Just me.

379
00:35:02,367 --> 00:35:05,062
That was scary.

380
00:35:09,174 --> 00:35:11,767
- Shaggy.
- Oh, dear.

381
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:17,915
What is this place?

382
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:19,283
It's my private workroom.

383
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:22,319
This is where I create props
and illusions for the students.

384
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,556
I heard noises and found
these 2 snooping around.

385
00:35:25,557 --> 00:35:30,289
No harm done, Miss Alma. I'm happy
to give them a demonstration.

386
00:35:35,901 --> 00:35:37,168
That's amazing.

387
00:35:37,169 --> 00:35:40,671
Thank you. It's a 3-dimensional
volumetric display.

388
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:44,508
Think of it as an upgrade on,
you know, your traditional hologram.

389
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:47,511
Yes, my big brother's
quite the showman.

390
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:49,673
Alakazam.

391
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:55,119
That was a little illusion he
whipped up for my farewell tour.

392
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,600
- Wait, you two are brothers?
- Funny, isn't it?

393
00:35:57,601 --> 00:36:01,525
I get stuck with the looks,
while lucky Marlon here, the brains.

394
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:04,927
Yeah, lucky me.

395
00:36:07,766 --> 00:36:11,502
I'm in the early stages. Right now
I can only create small things.

396
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:13,504
But someday...

397
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:18,576
Hey, I just had a thought. Maybe the
griffin is just like a humongous hologram.

398
00:36:18,577 --> 00:36:21,011
Yeah, humongous hologram.

399
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:24,949
Nice try, you guys, except
holograms don't rip through trees.

400
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:28,010
- Like, not even little ones?
- Sorry.

401
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:31,822
By the way, Miss Crystal,
if that is your real name...

402
00:36:31,823 --> 00:36:35,492
how is it that you knew exactly which
button to push to shut off the system?

403
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:38,655
Uh, because it says off?

404
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:41,098
- Oh.
- If you ask me, Whirlen...

405
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:45,236
all this electronic fakery is exactly
what's doomed your school.

406
00:36:45,237 --> 00:36:50,574
The students don't need to learn
a lot of hokey Las Vegas illusions.

407
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:53,877
They should learn the real
magic of O'Flannery Castle...

408
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:58,082
with all of its wonder and romance.

409
00:36:58,083 --> 00:37:01,485
And do you have any stories
of romance you'd like to share?

410
00:37:01,486 --> 00:37:03,505
Heh, heh. Heavens.

411
00:37:03,506 --> 00:37:06,757
I'm just a caretaker.

412
00:37:06,758 --> 00:37:09,293
I leave the storytelling
to the teachers.

413
00:37:09,294 --> 00:37:11,829
And if the teachers are smart...

414
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:16,133
they'll treat the tradition of
O'Flannery Castle with more respect.

415
00:37:16,134 --> 00:37:18,335
That's the reason the
griffin's come back.

416
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:19,570
What do you mean?

417
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:23,841
It's here to return the castle
to the days of true magic.

418
00:37:23,842 --> 00:37:25,900
The way it should be.

419
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:32,016
Okay, okay, Miss Rumblebuns.
We get it. Thank you.

420
00:37:32,017 --> 00:37:35,252
Well, no one can say she's not
passionate about her work.

421
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:38,822
Shaggy, Shaggy, Shaggy.
Oh, my gosh, I found it.

422
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:40,090
I found the magic staff.

423
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:44,220
You found the magic what? Yipe!

424
00:37:51,803 --> 00:37:53,637
I was reading about Lord O'Flannery.

425
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:58,142
He used a special magic staff to
summon the griffin and control it.

426
00:37:58,143 --> 00:38:00,577
Where is this magic staff?

427
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:03,280
Lord O'Flannery had it
placed in his tomb...

428
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:07,051
which is on an island right
here in Shadow Lake.

429
00:38:07,052 --> 00:38:08,419
It's real close.

430
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,854
That's the same direction
the griffin came from.

431
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:14,892
You won't wanna be
going there, my friends.

432
00:38:14,893 --> 00:38:19,663
What that fancy book won't tell you is
when Lord O'Flannery came from Ireland...

433
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:23,292
with him came his clan's banshee.

434
00:38:23,568 --> 00:38:27,299
Banshee, like,
that's a good thing, right?

435
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:32,743
It's a hideous female ghost whose
wailing dooms whoever hears it.

436
00:38:33,411 --> 00:38:35,045
Not listening.

437
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:41,485
Legend says the banshee
wailed over Lord O'Flannery...

438
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:44,855
as he breathed his last breath.

439
00:38:44,856 --> 00:38:48,425
To this day, the ghost
guards his tomb...

440
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:54,865
ready to attack any who would
disturb the dark wizard's slumber.

441
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,531
You all have a pleasant evening.

442
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:06,110
Alrighty, who's up for pie?

443
00:39:06,111 --> 00:39:09,580
Come on, Shaggy, we gotta find
that staff. It could be a clue.

444
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:20,557
Shadow Lake is a
quarter-mile ahead. Spooky.

445
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:29,466
We better stick together, gang.

446
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:31,935
Remember, that banshee
could be anywhere.

447
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:36,304
Man, no matter how hard I try,
I can't forget something like that.

448
00:39:59,631 --> 00:40:03,464
All ashore who's going ashore.

449
00:40:24,022 --> 00:40:26,490
We should be getting close, gang.

450
00:40:26,491 --> 00:40:28,652
Through here.

451
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:40,197
How about we go over?

452
00:40:44,843 --> 00:40:46,910
How did you do...? Oh!

453
00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:55,819
Fred, you okay?

454
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,588
Yeah.

455
00:40:57,589 --> 00:41:00,491
I guess we all have our
danger-prone days.

456
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:24,175
I think Scooby found something.

457
00:41:31,122 --> 00:41:33,453
Check out this strange marking.

458
00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:40,130
Each monolith has its own.

459
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:43,122
And I found another on the floor.

460
00:41:48,306 --> 00:41:50,205
There's one here too.

461
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,845
Uh-oh.

462
00:42:06,658 --> 00:42:09,326
Oh, well, I guess we'll never
get in that kooky crypt.

463
00:42:09,327 --> 00:42:13,228
Let's head back to the
castle and make enchiladas.

464
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,833
It moved. Oh, man.

465
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:18,735
Shaggy did it.

466
00:42:18,736 --> 00:42:21,670
Come on, I bet if we push it...

467
00:42:21,806 --> 00:42:25,469
All right, everyone push.

468
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:41,756
A secret door. Let's go.

469
00:42:48,433 --> 00:42:50,366
Scooby, run.

470
00:42:54,706 --> 00:42:57,231
Hurry, Scoob.

471
00:43:02,547 --> 00:43:04,378
Phew.

472
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,560
It's the O'Flannery crest.

473
00:43:16,561 --> 00:43:19,256
Help me get the lid off.

474
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:29,139
That must be O'Flannery's staff.

475
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:32,268
And that must be O'Flannery.

476
00:43:32,477 --> 00:43:34,511
- I'll get it.
- Wait, wait, wait.

477
00:43:34,512 --> 00:43:37,714
Only the bravest hero
should retrieve it.

478
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:40,740
Oh, all right.

479
00:43:55,433 --> 00:43:59,169
- Scooby, do you mind?
- Sorry, Shaggy.

480
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:01,071
It's okay. Thanks for the hand.

481
00:44:01,072 --> 00:44:05,440
- Uh, uh, Shaggy.
- Zoinks.

482
00:44:07,345 --> 00:44:11,748
Yup, that's me, Shaggy Rogers,
the bravest of heroes.

483
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:16,920
Shaggy, we have a visitor.

484
00:44:16,921 --> 00:44:21,658
Then, like, why is
nobody saying hello?

485
00:44:25,296 --> 00:44:28,765
Uh-huh. Bravest of heroes.

486
00:44:30,535 --> 00:44:34,071
So that's the banshee?
She doesn't look scary.

487
00:44:34,072 --> 00:44:36,631
Yeah, she looks kind of pretty.

488
00:44:47,785 --> 00:44:49,946
Out here.

489
00:44:58,629 --> 00:45:00,630
We gotta get back to the boat.

490
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:04,328
We can't leave the staff. Come on.

491
00:45:10,508 --> 00:45:12,476
- Where'd they go?
- They'll be here.

492
00:45:12,477 --> 00:45:13,944
Let's get the boat turned around.

493
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:18,807
Madelyn!

494
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:23,509
Coming through.

495
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:38,394
Push us off, Shaggy.

496
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:22,479
Nice footwork, Shaggy.

497
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,849
Let's get this back to the
castle and analyze it for clues.

498
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:29,046
I can't believe how you
saved us like that.

499
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:33,490
Yeah, well, I do have
some major feet.

500
00:46:33,491 --> 00:46:37,074
It's more than your feet,
Shaggy. It's you.

501
00:46:37,075 --> 00:46:40,230
You're so amazing, so forceful.

502
00:46:40,231 --> 00:46:44,792
I think you're the bravest,
most wonderful boy I have ever known.

503
00:46:44,936 --> 00:46:48,703
Oh, gee, Madelyn. I...

504
00:46:48,706 --> 00:46:50,707
I like you too.

505
00:46:50,708 --> 00:46:53,877
Aw. Mwah, mwah, mwah.

506
00:46:53,878 --> 00:46:56,175
It's getting late.

507
00:47:07,258 --> 00:47:11,524
What are you waiting for?
Directions? Drive!

508
00:47:31,816 --> 00:47:33,116
Shoo, griffin.

509
00:47:33,117 --> 00:47:36,108
Like, be gone already.

510
00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:40,090
I think the batteries are dead.

511
00:47:40,091 --> 00:47:44,861
Hey, I put a box of magic explosives
in the van for practice on the field.

512
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:48,198
Like, Scooby-Doo,
let's strike this griffin out.

513
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:50,690
Yeah, strike-out.

514
00:48:09,287 --> 00:48:12,889
Uh-oh. I think Scooby dropped
a live explosive in the box.

515
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:16,188
- Like, which one?
- I can't tell.

516
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:31,740
We haven't lost him yet, guys.

517
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:45,455
Hurry, inside.

518
00:48:45,456 --> 00:48:48,356
Hey, you're gonna leave me out here?

519
00:48:51,729 --> 00:48:53,763
What's all the ruckus?

520
00:48:56,233 --> 00:48:59,725
Griffin attack, run.

521
00:48:59,904 --> 00:49:01,666
Huh?

522
00:49:08,379 --> 00:49:10,814
Let's get the staff to Whirlen.

523
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,587
Oh, no.

524
00:49:17,588 --> 00:49:19,419
Like, don't do it.

525
00:49:27,198 --> 00:49:32,068
- Madelyn!
- Velma!

526
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:34,560
Oh, no.

527
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:40,176
Mr. Curdles, events have taken
a terrible turn over here.

528
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:43,305
You might wanna see for yourself.

529
00:49:55,026 --> 00:49:56,793
I don't understand.

530
00:49:56,794 --> 00:49:59,262
Why are you taking
all these magic tricks?

531
00:49:59,263 --> 00:50:01,898
They're the only weapons
we have against the griffin.

532
00:50:01,899 --> 00:50:04,834
But you don't even know
where the griffin's taken her.

533
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,636
We have a pretty good idea.

534
00:50:06,637 --> 00:50:09,706
We believe it's called the
Griffin's Roost for a reason.

535
00:50:09,707 --> 00:50:12,275
The Griffin's Roost?
But it's not safe.

536
00:50:12,276 --> 00:50:15,145
The whole place is liable to
crash down on your heads.

537
00:50:15,146 --> 00:50:19,349
We'll be careful. Besides, if there are
any clues I'm sure we'll find them there.

538
00:50:25,823 --> 00:50:28,518
Like, I'm ready.

539
00:50:29,994 --> 00:50:31,728
Why are you wearing armor?

540
00:50:31,729 --> 00:50:36,723
Because even with this magic doohickey,
I need all the protection I can get.

541
00:50:37,802 --> 00:50:39,969
Whirly, are you all right?

542
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:42,839
This griffin business
has beaten me, Marlon.

543
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:46,576
It's time to bring down the
curtain on this magic school.

544
00:50:46,577 --> 00:50:48,411
My dream.

545
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:55,518
Touching. Touching.

546
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:58,221
Your most heartfelt
performance, Whirlen.

547
00:50:58,222 --> 00:51:00,390
Now, rejoice.

548
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:05,662
Kindly Calvin Curdles is here with the
silver lining to your cloud of despair.

549
00:51:05,663 --> 00:51:08,832
- How did you get in?
- Through the door.

550
00:51:08,833 --> 00:51:13,670
I'm prepared to take thismonster-
blighted castle off your hands.

551
00:51:13,671 --> 00:51:17,640
I'll even give you
a third... No, no, no.

552
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:21,907
Make that an 8th of
what you paid for it.

553
00:51:24,448 --> 00:51:28,084
Well, this is hardly the time
for real-estate transactions.

554
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:29,953
When it comes to business matters...

555
00:51:29,954 --> 00:51:33,756
Calvin Curdles was never one
to consider people's feelings.

556
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:37,560
Now, now, Alma,
perhaps I'm doing us all a favor.

557
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:41,064
You've said there was no griffin
before these 2 took over the castle.

558
00:51:41,065 --> 00:51:45,524
- But we're not to blame.
- It's okay, Marlon.

559
00:51:45,736 --> 00:51:47,567
Where do I sign?

560
00:51:49,807 --> 00:51:52,142
I think you should
wait till we get back.

561
00:51:52,143 --> 00:51:56,079
There's more to this griffin
business than meets the eye.

562
00:51:56,080 --> 00:52:00,116
You know, I really,
really don't like her.

563
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:04,053
Just give us an hour. Let's go, guys.

564
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:21,931
- What happened?
- Like, it was the banshee.

565
00:53:21,932 --> 00:53:24,525
But she split when Scooby tripped.

566
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:26,794
It's a wire.

567
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:39,482
- What is it, a camera?
- I don't think so, Fred.

568
00:53:39,483 --> 00:53:41,618
Help! Help!

569
00:53:41,619 --> 00:53:43,319
Madelyn.

570
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,481
Madelyn? Where?

571
00:53:45,556 --> 00:53:48,047
Up here.

572
00:53:52,529 --> 00:53:55,520
Help! Help!

573
00:53:57,334 --> 00:53:59,631
Help!

574
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:08,204
Can anybody hear me? Help!

575
00:54:41,445 --> 00:54:44,277
The stair moved.

576
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:03,125
Here's a way out.

577
00:55:20,951 --> 00:55:23,486
Help! Help!

578
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:25,614
She's on the other side.

579
00:55:51,448 --> 00:55:53,149
Try the staff again.

580
00:55:53,150 --> 00:55:55,584
The staff?

581
00:56:00,324 --> 00:56:04,726
Like, you shall not pass, man.

582
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:11,000
It worked.

583
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:17,506
It didn't work.

584
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:19,732
We're done for.

585
00:56:29,586 --> 00:56:31,917
Not yet.

586
00:56:33,857 --> 00:56:36,086
Let him have it.

587
00:56:47,004 --> 00:56:49,335
The smoke bombs.

588
00:57:08,692 --> 00:57:11,057
Run!

589
00:57:24,208 --> 00:57:28,109
Shaggy, Scooby, are you okay?

590
00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:33,282
Like, I think I still
have all my pieces.

591
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:36,118
Stay there, we'll come
back with help.

592
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:39,645
That's the best idea
I've heard, like, ever.

593
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,665
- The griffin.
- It's back.

594
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:52,566
But, like, Fred told
us to stay right here.

595
00:57:56,206 --> 00:58:00,476
Help! Help! Can anybody hear me?

596
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:04,280
Like, she'll probably be okay
until help comes, don't you think?

597
00:58:04,281 --> 00:58:07,183
Shaggy, Madelyn likes you.

598
00:58:07,184 --> 00:58:10,915
Well, since you put
it that way, Scoob.

599
00:58:21,999 --> 00:58:26,629
Like, dude, peep that crazy lock,
and that's without the key.

600
00:58:27,538 --> 00:58:29,305
Shaggy, look.

601
00:58:29,306 --> 00:58:30,830
Huh?

602
00:58:32,576 --> 00:58:35,044
Good work, Scoob.

603
00:58:37,548 --> 00:58:39,777
Yeah.

604
00:59:13,283 --> 00:59:15,351
Shaggy.

605
00:59:15,352 --> 00:59:19,254
- Hey, Mads, you okay?
- I am now.

606
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:24,260
I mean, the griffin dropped me
in the tower, then flew off.

607
00:59:24,261 --> 00:59:27,096
I hope he doesn't come
back for a midnight snack.

608
00:59:39,009 --> 00:59:42,645
Quick, Scooby-Doo, pull something out
of that bag that will help us escape.

609
00:59:42,646 --> 00:59:44,909
Okay.

610
01:00:04,234 --> 01:00:06,133
We can climb down on these.

611
01:00:07,304 --> 01:00:11,171
Like, I don't know.
It seems kind of flimsy.

612
01:00:13,977 --> 01:00:17,037
- Come on.
- Go.

613
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:48,007
Like, beat it, Tweety.

614
01:00:57,254 --> 01:00:59,889
Where's the seat belt on this thing?

615
01:01:01,758 --> 01:01:03,592
Those kids won't find anything.

616
01:01:03,593 --> 01:01:05,617
Why delay the inevitable?

617
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:09,031
I suppose you're right.

618
01:01:09,032 --> 01:01:11,667
But I do hate letting
down my students.

619
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:14,659
Oh, yes, it's a tragedy.
Sign here, please.

620
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:28,510
The griffin is in the old tower.

621
01:01:29,786 --> 01:01:32,220
Come on.

622
01:01:40,797 --> 01:01:42,355
There they are.

623
01:01:47,337 --> 01:01:49,638
Shaggy, try the staff again.

624
01:01:49,639 --> 01:01:53,040
- Dude, it's a fake.
- Just try.

625
01:01:54,311 --> 01:01:56,245
I totally command you.

626
01:01:56,246 --> 01:02:00,816
By the powers of Houdini,
the Wizard of Oz...

627
01:02:00,817 --> 01:02:04,286
and, um, the English
kid with the glasses...

628
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:07,221
to put us down.

629
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:18,223
Like, dude, we're losing altitude.

630
01:02:29,179 --> 01:02:31,840
Little help, little help!

631
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:46,793
Shaggy got him.
Isn't that incredible?

632
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:49,929
Yeah.

633
01:02:50,066 --> 01:02:52,101
You really are brave.

634
01:02:52,102 --> 01:02:55,304
Like, don't squeeze me, Madelyn.

635
01:02:55,305 --> 01:02:57,907
You're denting my metal.

636
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:13,255
The poor thing looks hurt.
Why doesn't it fly away?

637
01:03:16,092 --> 01:03:18,787
There's your answer.

638
01:03:33,109 --> 01:03:37,379
- The griffin, it's a gigantic puppet?
- Correct.

639
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:40,314
This whole charade
is making sense now.

640
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,454
Run!

641
01:03:45,455 --> 01:03:47,547
Whoa.

642
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:58,100
Marlon, you?

643
01:03:58,101 --> 01:04:02,938
Marlon operated that contraption trying
to scare everyone away once and for all.

644
01:04:02,939 --> 01:04:05,600
But Shaggy and Scooby
spoiled his plans.

645
01:04:07,344 --> 01:04:09,678
So the monster never was real.

646
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:14,016
No, just a more sophisticated version
of the puppets in your magic act...

647
01:04:14,017 --> 01:04:15,784
when you and Marlon were kids.

648
01:04:15,785 --> 01:04:19,655
The blimp carried the griffin beneath
it to make it look like it was flying.

649
01:04:19,656 --> 01:04:21,824
But how did he disguise the blimp?

650
01:04:21,825 --> 01:04:25,294
Remember how every time the
griffin appeared, it was foggy?

651
01:04:25,295 --> 01:04:29,993
The blimp generated its
own concealing fog bank.

652
01:04:32,202 --> 01:04:36,071
I noticed some of the bottles in
Marlon's workshop were marked glycerol.

653
01:04:36,072 --> 01:04:40,509
A chemical used by professional
illusionists in fog machines.

654
01:04:40,510 --> 01:04:42,645
I used the fog to hide the blimp...

655
01:04:42,646 --> 01:04:46,980
then worked the griffin through
this handheld animatronic control.

656
01:04:50,854 --> 01:04:53,455
What about when the griffin
attacked us in the tower?

657
01:04:53,456 --> 01:04:57,259
- It couldn't have been the same puppet.
- It wasn't.

658
01:04:57,260 --> 01:05:02,131
After Whirlen bought the castle,
I started renovating the Griffin's Roost.

659
01:05:02,132 --> 01:05:06,602
I discovered Lord O' Flannery had rigged
parts of the tower with devices of his own...

660
01:05:06,603 --> 01:05:09,605
to make superstitious people
think a monster lived there.

661
01:05:09,606 --> 01:05:11,607
When trespassers entered the tower...

662
01:05:11,608 --> 01:05:14,643
they would be driven away
by the attacking griffin.

663
01:05:14,644 --> 01:05:16,211
I kept the secret to myself...

664
01:05:16,212 --> 01:05:20,045
and outfitted the worn-out machinery
with state-of-the-art equipment.

665
01:05:22,819 --> 01:05:25,254
Okay, but who is the banshee?

666
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:27,323
- Another puppet, right?
- Partially.

667
01:05:27,324 --> 01:05:30,726
Marlon had several rigged to
appear in various places.

668
01:05:30,727 --> 01:05:33,562
Even in the lake, to make it
look like she was chasing us.

669
01:05:33,563 --> 01:05:35,631
She wasn't a puppet every time.

670
01:05:35,632 --> 01:05:39,568
Yes, I realized that when we
saw the device in the tower.

671
01:05:39,569 --> 01:05:43,706
It was really a projector Marlon
uses for his volumetric displays.

672
01:05:43,707 --> 01:05:45,541
One of many.

673
01:05:45,542 --> 01:05:50,479
Anyone entering the tower would
have set off an invisible electric eye...

674
01:05:51,348 --> 01:05:54,214
activating the ghost.

675
01:05:55,485 --> 01:05:59,722
Marlon's technology was a lot more
sophisticated than he was letting on.

676
01:05:59,723 --> 01:06:02,624
Marlon, why did you do this?

677
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:06,061
Because all my life I've been
jealous, jealous of you.

678
01:06:06,062 --> 01:06:08,964
While I did all the work,
you got all the applause.

679
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:11,967
I finally decided I wanted
to create my own magic act.

680
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:15,838
With my puppets and projections,
I could become a magic sensation.

681
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:17,172
Why didn't you?

682
01:06:17,173 --> 01:06:19,274
Because I needed money
to start the act.

683
01:06:19,275 --> 01:06:22,611
The only way I could get it is if
you agreed to sell the castle...

684
01:06:22,612 --> 01:06:25,681
which I knew you wouldn't do
unless you were forced to.

685
01:06:25,682 --> 01:06:28,617
I didn't mean to hurt anyone, honest.

686
01:06:28,618 --> 01:06:31,286
All I wanted to do
was scare people away.

687
01:06:31,287 --> 01:06:35,053
I tried to make amends. After the
automated griffin wrecked the bridge,

688
01:06:35,054 --> 01:06:37,893
I flew back in the blimp
to bring you down.

689
01:06:37,894 --> 01:06:42,956
But these 2 fearless souls attacked
me before I could explain.

690
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:47,236
- Hey, how did the griffin crash anyway?
- Here's your answer.

691
01:06:47,237 --> 01:06:48,804
The magic staff?

692
01:06:48,805 --> 01:06:52,866
Like, I guess, it really did
control the monster after all.

693
01:06:53,209 --> 01:06:55,511
Aw, I'm so ashamed.

694
01:07:02,952 --> 01:07:07,156
Who would have thought that
miserable Marlon would be behind this?

695
01:07:07,157 --> 01:07:10,148
You would. You knew all along.

696
01:07:11,494 --> 01:07:16,498
Of course, Amos was the only one who
was never afraid to be out at night.

697
01:07:16,499 --> 01:07:19,101
He must have known
the griffin was a fake.

698
01:07:19,102 --> 01:07:24,039
Amos probably followed Marlon to the
Griffin's Roost while he was rebuilding it.

699
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:29,078
I saw him going in there, day and night,
with loads of strange-looking crates.

700
01:07:29,079 --> 01:07:31,380
So I got nosy and peeked.

701
01:07:31,381 --> 01:07:35,384
Yes, and my guess is he
told you, Mr. Curdles.

702
01:07:35,385 --> 01:07:37,553
You weren't worried
about the griffin.

703
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:40,622
You could even use it to get
a cheap price on the castle.

704
01:07:40,623 --> 01:07:45,287
- Wow. These girlies are smart.
- Oh, shut up.

705
01:07:45,328 --> 01:07:47,663
No need to deny it, Mr. Curdles.

706
01:07:47,664 --> 01:07:50,632
Your story about turning the
castle into a restaurant...

707
01:07:50,633 --> 01:07:52,935
never made sense in the first place.

708
01:07:52,936 --> 01:07:56,605
You were really buying it for
Miss Rumblebuns, weren't you?

709
01:07:56,606 --> 01:07:58,937
Calvin, is this true?

710
01:07:58,975 --> 01:08:03,036
Yes, Alma, it is. I meant
for it to be a surprise.

711
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:06,582
You see, years ago, I operated a
struggling ice-cream concession here...

712
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:11,144
for the few tourists who
visited O' Flannery Castle.

713
01:08:15,358 --> 01:08:18,657
It was here that I met the
castle's dazzling caretaker,

714
01:08:18,658 --> 01:08:21,762
Miss Alma Rumblebuns.

715
01:08:24,801 --> 01:08:29,171
Ah. We were so much in love.

716
01:08:29,172 --> 01:08:31,673
Fearing that a high-born
creature of Alma's caste...

717
01:08:31,674 --> 01:08:36,712
could never settle for a
mere sherbet jockey, I left.

718
01:08:36,713 --> 01:08:40,482
Determined someday to return
a frozen-novelty mogul.

719
01:08:40,483 --> 01:08:45,454
Alas, I became so swept up in the
intoxicating world of cream and cones...

720
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:48,719
I never came back.

721
01:08:48,825 --> 01:08:51,160
But I couldn't forget you, Alma.

722
01:08:51,161 --> 01:08:55,097
I thought that if I bought you this
castle which you loved so much...

723
01:08:55,098 --> 01:08:57,930
you might love me again.

724
01:08:58,067 --> 01:09:00,762
Oh, Calvin, I don't know what to say.

725
01:09:01,771 --> 01:09:05,900
Well, just say you forgive me.

726
01:09:07,343 --> 01:09:09,174
Ew.

727
01:09:11,948 --> 01:09:15,350
Please, Whirlen,
I will double the price.

728
01:09:15,351 --> 01:09:18,620
Don't do it, Whirlen,
I couldn't take the money now.

729
01:09:18,621 --> 01:09:21,290
Not when I've seen what
the school means to you.

730
01:09:21,291 --> 01:09:22,824
I was wrong.

731
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:24,593
My place is here with you...

732
01:09:24,594 --> 01:09:27,930
passing on what we've discovered
to kids who truly wanna learn.

733
01:09:27,931 --> 01:09:30,666
They're the ones I've really hurt.

734
01:09:30,667 --> 01:09:33,829
I think there's time to make amends.

735
01:09:36,339 --> 01:09:40,375
Starting with the education of our
new apprentice, Madelyn Dinkley.

736
01:09:40,376 --> 01:09:42,377
Really? You mean it?

737
01:09:42,378 --> 01:09:45,377
With your enthusiasm
and our coaching,

738
01:09:45,378 --> 01:09:48,283
you could be the next
big thing in magic.

739
01:09:48,284 --> 01:09:51,887
Congratulations, Madelyn.
You deserve it.

740
01:09:51,888 --> 01:09:56,225
I must admit, you handled yourself
pretty well on this adventure.

741
01:09:56,226 --> 01:09:57,405
Thanks.

742
01:09:57,406 --> 01:10:01,691
I guess we Dinkley sisters have
something in common after all.

743
01:10:06,502 --> 01:10:08,128
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

744
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:12,908
The Cone Castle Creamery, makers
of those cones that make you moan...

745
01:10:12,909 --> 01:10:15,577
is proud to sponsor
the very first show...

746
01:10:15,578 --> 01:10:19,715
by the students of the Merlin
Brothers' Academy of Magic.

747
01:10:19,716 --> 01:10:23,218
And now your hosts,
Marlon and Whirlen...

748
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:27,489
the Brothers Merlin.

749
01:10:43,006 --> 01:10:46,174
- Isn't she adorable?
- Yeah.

750
01:10:46,175 --> 01:10:50,941
- Hey, shouldn't you be up there with her?
- I've been training an assistant.

751
01:11:19,475 --> 01:11:24,313
- How did you do that?
- That's my secret, scarf boy.

752
01:11:24,314 --> 01:11:28,750
- Like, that was totally awesome, Mads.
- Thanks, Shaggy.

753
01:11:28,751 --> 01:11:32,243
Hey, have you seen Scooby-Doo?

754
01:11:35,391 --> 01:11:39,094
- Oh.
- Let's go, move, move.

755
01:11:52,675 --> 01:11:55,677
Looks like your dog is
braver than you thought.

756
01:11:55,678 --> 01:12:01,275
Thank you, thank you,
thank you. And thank you.

757
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:08,923
Scooby-abracadabra-Doo!
